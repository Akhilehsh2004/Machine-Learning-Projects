    "### **7. Example Usage**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Recommended Movies for 'Inception':\")\n",
    "print(recommend_movie('Inception'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Calls the `recommend_movie` function with the title `'Inception'`.  \n",
    "- Prints out the list of recommended movies similar to **Inception**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the Recommendation Works:**  \n",
    "1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts the descriptions into vectors, where more significant words have higher weights.  \n",
    "2. **Cosine Similarity in KNN**: Measures the angle between vectors to determine similarity (0° means identical, 90° means completely different).  \n",
    "3. **Nearest Neighbors**: Identifies movies with the closest vector angles, meaning the most similar content.  \n",
    "4. **Recommendation**: Returns the top 3 similar movies excluding the original one. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Result Example:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Recommended Movies for 'Inception':\n",
    "['Interstellar', 'The Matrix', 'The Dark Knight']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that movie recommendations are based on **semantic similarity** in their descriptions."
